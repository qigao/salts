 * Client-side REMOTE endpoint selection, separate from local SG Owner placement
 * and protocol-aware connection-pool acquisition.  Selection never opens,
 * reconnects, borrows or retries a CNet connection.
 *
 * The host supplies one immutable endpoint-set snapshot, already filtered for
 * authority, TLS/security profile, protocol and caller eligibility.  Endpoint
 * IDs must be nonzero, strictly ascending and stable within the generation.
 * A changed set must publish a new nonzero generation.  The snapshot must
 * outlive this evaluation; later dial/acquisition owns its copied endpoint
 * identity and uses the same trust/authority criteria.
