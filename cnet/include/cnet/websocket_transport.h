/* Bind a dedicated, connected TCP/TLS stream after the host has validated HTTP
 * Upgrade/authentication. This is a write/terminal bridge, not an HTTP parser
 * or H2 adapter. Requires no outstanding writes, shutdown or TLS upgrade;
 * EBUSY leaves both objects unchanged. configuration.write must be NULL and
 * output_buffer must supply the retained frame storage. The bridge copies the
 * configuration, retains output through the engine, and borrows callback users.
 * The maximum encoded frame must fit the client's send budget (EMSGSIZE).
 * Other errors: EINVAL, ENOENT (stale connection), ENOTSUP (non TCP/TLS),
 * ENOTCONN, ESHUTDOWN (client stopping), ENOMEM/ERANGE, and underlying
 * tagged-engine configuration errors.
 *
 * Success exclusively owns stream writes until real CLOSED/FAILED: ordinary
 * cnet_send_* are rejected with EBUSY; in-place TLS/shutdown are blocked.
 * CNet successful sends are routed directly to the engine, not the original
 * observer.on_send. Original
 * receive/state observers remain installed. Host drives receive demand and
 * feeds borrowed input into the session on this same Owner, respecting EBUSY.
 * Queue-full non-admission becomes bounded WS EBUSY; permanent errors remain
 * errors. Close through CNet, keep advancing both CNet and WS until drained.
 * No worker, backend, retry loop, protocol READY or application replay is added.
 * client must remain alive until its terminal callback; all operations are
 * single-Owner, and the bridge/engine must outlive their callbacks.
