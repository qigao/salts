/*
 * Pure server-side selection of a fixed final network Owner.  Called only at
 * connection admission, never for an established stream or each TCP packet.
 * Owner indices are the stable [0, owner_count) shard indices.  Their order
 * MUST be identical among listeners for STRICT_KEY deterministic placement.
 *
 * This is a decision ONLY, not a capacity reservation.  The host must still
 * commit against cnet_handoff_reserve() for remote Owners or
 * cnet_manager_reserve() + real CNet admission on the local Owner.
 * A pressure snapshot may be stale; returned success never promises credits.
 * No thread, queue, backend, allocation, connection move or retry is created.
