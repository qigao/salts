The local [minicoro](https://github.com/edubart/minicoro) ARM64 entry trampoline
uses a real call return address instead of the non-canonical `deaddead` sentinel.
This allows compiler-generated pointer authentication when a completed coroutine
switches back to its caller, including an optimized tail call. PAC/BTI compiler
settings remain enabled. The public coroutine completion, reset and nested-return
contracts are covered by `cmeta_coroutine_completion_test`.
