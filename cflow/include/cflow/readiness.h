 * Publisher/owner state and clears the caller registration. Any failure clears
 * out and owner while leaving registration and user ownership with the caller.
 * Only trivial-copy, trivial-destroy value types are admitted.
 *
 * Publisher cancellation is terminal: it quiescently closes the registration,
 * then invokes close(user) once. Publisher destroy releases its state reference
 * even if Platform close fails; owner keeps registration/user reachable.
 *
 * owner is not thread-safe and must not be moved or closed concurrently.
 * owner_close returns SALTS_EBUSY without side effects while the Publisher still
 * exists. After Publisher destroy, it returns the exact Platform close error and
 * retains owner for retry. SALTS_OK clears owner and releases its final ref;
 * callers must close owner even when Publisher cleanup already succeeded.
