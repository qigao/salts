/** Caller-owned scratch regions. Capacities are bytes except scalar_capacity

 * its contents are unspecified afterward. No allocations or retained pointers.
 * mapped holds UTS #46 mapped UTF-8, normalized holds its NFC plus terminal NUL,
 * scalars holds the canonical decomposition required by salts_unicode_nfc.
 * Capacities are explicit application budgets: mapping/normalization can expand
 * input before DNS length checking. Insufficiency is WORKSPACE, not invalid DNS.
 * Example budgets for interactive hostnames: 4096 mapped bytes, 4096 normalized
 * bytes, 4096 scalars. These are application choices, not universal guarantees.

/** Synchronous UTF-8 domain -> lowercase ASCII connection identity.
 * profile must be SALTS_IDNA_UNICODE17_UTS46_35_STRICT: nontransitional,
 * STD3, hyphen, Bidi, ContextJ, DNS length checks; invalid Punycode rejected.
 * Additionally enforces RFC 5892 ContextO and rejects trailing dots/empty labels.
 * This profile is not full IDNA2008 or visual spoof/confusable detection.
 * Not a URL/IP/port parser; callers keep numeric-address handling separate.
 * Existing A-labels are decoded and validated, never repaired by normalization.
 * Input is borrowed for this call; bound input.len at the application boundary.
 * Input, output, scratch regions, workspace descriptor and out_size must all be
 * disjoint. Null scratch is allowed only with zero corresponding capacity.
 * output and out_size are required. All referenced storage remains caller-owned.
 * Success writes NUL-terminated ASCII; *out_size excludes NUL. All errors leave
 * output and *out_size unchanged. Do not submit failed output to DNS or TLS.
 * Use the SAME successful ASCII identity for DNS, TLS verification and SNI.
 * No I/O, cache, global mutable state or hidden allocations. Independent calls
 * with separate output/workspace may run concurrently. Errors name the failed
 * rule/resource; this API does not report source offsets or partial labels.
 * Example: salts_idna_to_ascii(vstr_from_cstr("b\xC3\xBC" "cher.de"),
 *   SALTS_IDNA_UNICODE17_UTS46_35_STRICT, &scratch, ascii, sizeof ascii, &size);
 * yields "xn--bcher-kva.de". A 254-byte output holds any successful result.
