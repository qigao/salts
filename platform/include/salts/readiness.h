 * and registration_capacity may not exceed UINT32_MAX - 1. The native factory
 * returns SALTS_ENOTSUP when no configured backend exists; it never falls back.
 * The explicit poll backend additionally rejects registration_capacity above
 * INT_MAX - 1 because poll() reports the ready descriptor count as int.
